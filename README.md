Problem statement:

All bank branches across India provide MUDRA loans. Such loans have created the low-cost credit concept for micro and small businesses. One of the leading financial institutions in India wants to leverage Machine Learning techniques to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and take proactive steps to reduce the magnitude of exposure to default in future.

The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the loan payment or not, given the recent data of all the loan transactions. This can help the institution to distinguish future applicants who might default. For each ID in the Test Dataset, you must predict the “Default” level.
